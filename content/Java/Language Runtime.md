# Language Runtime

A runtime system or runtime environment is a sub-system that exists both in the computer where a program is created and in the computers where the program is intended to be run.

At a high level, a language runtime contains:

- Loader: code from disk to memory (class loader in Java)
- Interpreter: bytecode to machine code
- Interface to communicate with other languages

**Open JDK is a language runtime.**
