# Character Stream & Byte Stream

## Character Stream

In Java, characters are stored using [Unicode conventions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html). Character stream automatically allows us to read/write data character by character. For example, FileReader and FileWriter are character streams used to read from the source and write to the destination.

**Character stream uses buffers by default. So nothing will be outputed before the stream has been closed with `close` or `flush` method.**

code example for Character Stream:
```java
import java.io.*;

public class GFG {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		FileReader sourceStream = null;
		
		try {
			sourceStream = new FileReader(
				"/Users/mayanksolanki/Desktop/demo.rtf");
			int temp;
			while ((temp = sourceStream.read()) != -1) {
				System.out.println((char)temp);
			}
    		System.out.print("Program successfully executed");
		} finally {
			if (sourceStream != null)
				sourceStream.close();
		}
	}
}
```

## Byte Stream

Byte streams process data byte by byte (8 bits). For example, [FileInputStream](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-io-fileinputstream-class-java/) is used to read from the source and FileOutputStream to write to the destination.

Byte streams don't use buffers by default.

code example for Byte Stream:
```java
import java.io.*;

public class GFG {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		FileInputStream sourceStream = null;
		FileOutputStream targetStream = null;
		
		try {
			sourceStream = new FileInputStream(
				"/Users/mayanksolanki/Desktop/demo.rtf");
			targetStream = new FileOutputStream(
				"/Users/mayanksolanki/Desktop/democopy.rtf");
			int temp;
			while ((temp = sourceStream.read()) != -1) {
				targetStream.write((byte)temp);
			}
    		System.out.print("Program successfully executed");
		} finally {
			if (sourceStream != null) {
				sourceStream.close();
			}
			if (targetStream != null) {
				targetStream.close();
			}
		}
	}
}
